# DMCA Takedown Notice

Hello GitHub, 

We are the team from [bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/) company. A repository hosted on your site is infringing on copyrights owned by our company.

Two hours ago, our company's backend source code was maliciously uploaded to a repository named 'openbilibili/go-common' without permission. This involves plenty of confidential information. Once revealed, it will strike a fatal blow to our company's website security. The unauthorized and infringing copy can be found at:

Under penalty of perjury we certify that the information contained in the notification is both true and accurate, and we have the authority to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright(s) involved.
